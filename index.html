        <p>I am Safvan Rahman. I am learning how to make a website with my brother's help. I am from Bangladesh but I am living in Istanbul currently. I love cats and Istaanbul has many of them. I sometimes go to feed the ones in my local park.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of the things I love to do</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching YouTube</li>
            <li>Playing with cars and hotwheels</li>
            <li>Exploring the city on metro and bus</li>
            <li>Mathematics and english</li>

        </ul>
        <p>I hope you like my first website. It is not very pretty but I am still learning and one day I plan to make it prettier</p>
